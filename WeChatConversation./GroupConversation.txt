oMean🎱 (2023-08-07 18:21:31): That’s it, brothers, I think we should have a meeting tomorrow night. First decide what questions to ask the client and then determine what the content should be. We can have a first version. Provide the graphic design to him and if everything goes well, I will make an appointment with them on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to see if we can meet online. If so, I hope everyone can come and listen together to ensure that everyone has the same information, because we are tutors. It still depends on the overall ability, so I hope that our group can surpass other groups in terms of progress this week
oMean🎱 (2023-08-07 18:21:47): Saturday meeting can be flexible, mainly depends on client feedback

Bug Yellow (2023-08-15 14:10:39): Just write gdd according to the milestone parts

Bug Yellow (2023-08-15 14:16:45): But the teacher wants gdd to draw as many pictures as possible, not all text.

Official reminder (2023-08-19 16:26:12): flask feels simpler than imagined
Official Reminder (2023-08-19 16:26:49): I feel that the local area network should be able to rub out next week
Hua Fan (2023-08-19 17:33:07): It is equivalent to uploading this to the LAN so that everyone in the LAN can access it.
Official Reminder (2023-08-19 17:35:25): It’s amazing, he can create something like a web page, but there’s no way to render those pictures, but he can set up the host to connect to the machine net
Official reminder (2023-08-19 17:35:33): You can view this website through LAN
Official reminder (2023-08-19 17:35:46): The difficult thing is actually to connect it with the front-end thing
Official reminder (2023-08-19 17:36:09): Simple html is OK, but our page made with react is empty when opened normally.
Hua Fan (2023-08-19 17:36:16): oh oh
Huafan (2023-08-19 17:36:18): indeed
Official reminder (2023-08-19 17:36:21): So you have to think about how to connect them together
Official reminder (2023-08-19 17:36:26): [expression]
Huafan (2023-08-19 17:36:28): It sounds a little difficult
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:36:30): Flask is quite similar to react
Huafan (2023-08-19 17:36:31): [expression]
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:36:39): Also create the app directly

Huafan (2023-08-19 17:37:18): [expression]
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:37:48): Anyway, I know that flask has a login library
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:38:04): There can be ready-made user verification directly
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:38:12): It’s not as complicated as we thought
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:38:15): There are many wheels
Huafan (2023-08-19 17:38:22): That's good
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:39:04): Then the connection between flask and react is through the flask api in react’s app js
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:39:16): I don’t think it’s too difficult.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:39:25): It only takes two or three days to learn and you can get started.
Hua Fan (2023-08-19 17:39:30): Oh, oh, then it won’t be difficult.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-19 17:39:42):[expression]

oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:50:19): I suddenly remembered
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:50:32): I remember that the client said that members would not only have two statements.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:50:42): There will be members who pay and members who don’t.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:50:50): There will be a gap in permissions
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:50:51): Huh?
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:51:07): Although maybe we don’t need to consider it
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:51:31): But similarly, admin may also have large and small permissions
Official reminder (2023-08-21 17:51:55): Probably not
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:52:01): Admins with small permissions may not be able to change the page? and so on, we have to ask
Official reminder (2023-08-21 17:52:04): Everyone is already admin
Official reminder (2023-08-21 17:52:11): They should all be insiders
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:52:31): There are also different sizes inside.
"Fr3: The admin with low authority may not be able to change the page? We have to ask about such demands."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
I think this should be divided into, for example, employee admin and specialized technician admin or boss admin.
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:53:01): It can be used as a problem at that time
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:53:08): When meeting the client
"Flower: I think this should be divided into, for example, the employee admin and the professional technician admin or the boss admin."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
right
Huafan (2023-08-21 17:53:17): admin should be assigned a type
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:53:25): Every admin can edit is too abstract
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:53:31): Equivalent to being the boss after joining the job
Hua Fan (2023-08-21 17:53:32): Then we may need to grant edit permissions based on type
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:53:47): If permissions are divided, I can only say
Huafan (2023-08-21 17:53:49): adminType == xxx can
Huafan (2023-08-21 17:53:53): This kind of
Hua Fan (2023-08-21 17:53:56): I feel like this
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:54:00): Not choosing membership is the best decision for this term

Huafan (2023-08-21 17:54:24): I want to laugh^^
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:54:36): I personally think that admin should be used by the person in charge of the website in their organization
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 17:54:45): I think they should have an employee who is responsible for changing content
Official reminder (2023-08-21 17:54:48): You can ask when the time comes
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 17:54:53): Yes
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:05): What you think is reasonable
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 17:55:06): The boss doesn't care about this
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:18): But don’t just focus on edit
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 17:55:21): You can ask about it then
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:22): There is also a teacher admin
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:28): admin with fees
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:30): You understand
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:55:34): Yes
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:38): Not one admin can manage everything
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:55:55): Subdivision of permissions is absolutely necessary
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 17:56:06): ok
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:56:12): It’s just that we only need to consider one kind of admin
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:56:21): It’s what you call an editor
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:56:32): Others are not under our control
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:56:42): I say this because if they really follow their thinking
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:56:43): Indeed
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:56:55): We need to find the corresponding type in db to judge
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:57:02): If they only have admin in db
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:57:10): Then we have nothing to do
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 17:57:51): Personally, I think they did not expect this step. I also think they should be reminded for the overall progress, but I doubt they will think that we are meddling. them[Facepalm]
Official reminder (2023-08-21 17:58:24): You can ask the client if they have such an idea, so that the client should talk about it when talking with them
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:58:32): See if this website is really going to be used
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:58:43): If it is out of responsibility to customers, it must be done
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:59:00): Although it has nothing to do with us^^
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:59:21): I also thought about db
Hua Fan(2023-08-21 17:59:25):[expression]
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:59:29): If we edit need to have editing history
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 17:59:34): That is to ask for db

Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 18:00:21): Isn’t all content in db
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:02:52):[expression]
Official reminder (2023-08-21 18:02:53): The ideal state is to record the operation and then undo the operation. The worst case is that the db needs to record the entire previous page and then cover it back.

agree
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:03:20): Because the editor is not connected to the db, it is too dangerous
Official reminder (2023-08-21 18:03:32): Indeed
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:03:35): I can’t recover by editing blindly
Official reminder (2023-08-21 18:03:37): It is too abstract to be restored
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 18:03:47): Indeed
Bug Yellow (2023-08-21 18:04:06): The edit function itself is dangerous
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:04:07): The more subdivided it is, the more we feel that we live a lot more
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:04:14): yaojiaqianq
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 18:04:17): Need to add money

Huafan (2023-08-21 18:24:10): It’s not why you can’t pass without the teacher
Huafan (2023-08-21 18:24:18): Isn’t this our own project?
Hua Fan (2023-08-21 18:24:31): chris also said this is your project
Huafan (2023-08-21 18:24:47): Then we should make up our own minds
Huafan (2023-08-21 18:24:56): hard to collapse
Hua Fan (2023-08-21 18:25:03): Seeing him say this makes me even more angry
Official reminder (2023-08-21 18:25:37): Chris gave a suggestion and they felt that their brains could not come up with a better idea, so they decided to blindly follow it.
Hua Fan (2023-08-21 18:26:21): It seems like we didn’t listen carefully to what the teacher said.

Official reminder (2023-08-21 19:03:22): Huh?
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 19:03:49): The definition of admin here is to only edit the website and place advertisements for maintenance
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 19:04:02): It seems to be two things with admin in membership
oMean🎱 (2023-08-21 19:04:30): If so, it is reasonable for them to be unhappy
Official Reminder (2023-08-21 19:04:36): If they are not in charge of Chris, why would they ask them to get an isadmin

oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:12): Then each of you upload a file
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:17): It’s also considered a commit.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:21): Just what the customer wants
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:24): Color or something
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:28): yes no
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:46:34): upload one by one
Official reminder (2023-08-28 18:50:15): Can each person post a picture with different colors?
Official reminder (2023-08-28 18:50:20): Still code directly
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:50:30): No
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:50:33): it is file
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:50:39): those worddocs
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:50:50): Because of code we already have a repo
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:51:10): This git is used to put things other than code
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 18:51:16): It can be some of our ideas or something like that
Hua Fan (2023-08-28 19:05:23): I edited the client’s meeting notes that day into md and uploaded them.
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 19:15:53): OK
Bug Yellow (2023-08-28 20:22:32): Wait, can these things other than code be recorded using dc?
Bug Yellow (2023-08-28 20:23:15): When uploading to github, it needs to be changed to md
Bug Yellow (2023-08-28 20:23:53): Wouldn’t it be more convenient to send the PDF directly to DC?
Bug Yellow (2023-08-28 20:28:17): He just wants a place where he can see our process
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 20:28:46): theoretically possible
Daniel Tan (2023-08-28 20:29:43): Then use dc?
Daniel Tan (2023-08-28 20:29:59): It is also very convenient for me

Huafan (2023-08-28 20:42:03): What docs need to be given a link on the doc of the canvas
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:42:22): We are unlikely to put a dc invitation link on it
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:42:31): You can also push pdf on git
oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 20:43:08): git should not only be able to push md
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:43:14): [Picture]
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:43:20): This is the place
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:43:30): We will not be able to put a dc link by then
Flower trouble (2023-08-28 20:43:32):[Lol]
Hua Fan (2023-08-28 20:43:55): git tracks a folder, so anything in it will be ok.
Bug Yellow (2023-08-28 20:43:59): that's fine too
Huafan (2023-08-28 20:44:00): No effect

oMean🎱 (2023-08-28 21:21:15): Isn’t it?
Hua Fan (2023-08-28 21:21:17): He is purely lip service (actually he doesn’t even know how to read it)

Huafan (2023-08-28 21:21:37): Then the meeting minutes are short of adding everyone's IP
