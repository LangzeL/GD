### Coding Standards Document

#### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed by the development team. Adherence to these standards will ensure high-quality code and a consistent coding style across the project.

#### 2. Code Structure and Layout

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 30 characters.
- **Whitespace**: Use whitespace to make the code more readable.

#### 3. Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use camelCase for variable names.
- **Functions/Methods**: Use PascalCase for function/method names.
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names.
- **Constants**: Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constant names.

#### 4. Commenting

- Write comments to explain the purpose and usage of the code.
- Use inline comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain complex code.
- Document functions/methods with their expected inputs, outputs, and any exceptions they may raise.

#### 5. Code Organization

- Organize code into logically related groups (classes, functions, etc.).
- Use separate files/modules for different components or functionality.
- Import dependencies at the beginning of the file.

#### 6. Error Handling

- Validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Return meaningful error messages to the user.
- Log errors with sufficient details for debugging.

#### 7. Testing

- Write unit tests for all functions/methods.
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices whenever possible.
- Ensure that the code passes all tests before committing.

#### 8. Version Control

- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Commit early and often.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.

#### 9. Code Review

- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- Address all feedback and resolve all discussions before merging the code.

#### 10. Documentation

- Document all classes, functions/methods, and modules.
- Keep the documentation up-to-date with the code.
- Use markdown for documentation.
