- All subsections are designed to be vertically stacked on mobile devices.
- Text will be relatively reduced on mobile devices.
- CSS formats will primarily use percentages to ensure responsive design.

### Next Steps:

1. **Resolve Current Challenges:**

4. **Enhance Responsive Design:**
   - Continue refining responsive design to ensure optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices, with appropriate adaptations for mobile devices.
