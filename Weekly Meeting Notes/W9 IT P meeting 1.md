   - Are you satisfied with what we have done so far, both functionally and design-wise? Is there anything we can improve or add?
6. **Tutorial Documentation:**
   - We are planning to create a tutorial PDF for GrapeJS. Would this be suitable for you?
7. **Navbar Font Color:**
   - Should we change the current yellow font color of the navbar to orange, as it may be more visually appealing?
8. **New Logo:**
   - Has the new logo been finalized and created?
