**Stage One: Frontend Design**

Yilin and Jack focused on what could be improved and differentiated from the original website. With a goal to enhance the design and facilitate our frontend development, we chose the React framework. The choice of color and other design elements were meticulously made to ensure that the website not only stands out but is also user-friendly and modern.

**Stage Two: Team Division and Reasoning Behind It**

In this stage, the team was divided into two main parts:

- **Responsiveness (Daniel):** Concentrated on ensuring the website’s design is responsive, adaptable to various screen sizes, and providing a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **Edit Function (Anson):** Focused on the development of the edit function, allowing for the easy and efficient editing of images and other content on the website.

**Final Stage: Deployment and Integration with Other Sections**

Here, we will discuss how our website compares with the original one and where our advantages lie.

- **Comparison with the Original Website (Wenda):** A detailed comparison will be presented, highlighting our website's strengths, improvements, and unique features in contrast to the original site.

**Summary**

In concluding, a summary of the overall process, key decisions, strategies employed, and the rationale behind them will be provided. This will encapsulate the essence of our presentation, giving a clear overview of our journey, challenges, and successes in developing the Longplace Beach Website.
